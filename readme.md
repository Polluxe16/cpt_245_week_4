# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview

This week we will 

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to read code with functions and determine the order that functions are called, as well as which functions are performing what programming logic, what their parameters are, how to create/use your own custom functions!

Functions are a VERY useful programming construct which allows you to write code which can be called many times!  This is useful in that you can perform the same sequence of programming logic repeatedly without needing to write the code repeatedly.  In fact - if you find yourself writing the same code repeatedly you are probably in need of a function!  

Further, you can write functions which include "parameters", which are variables that you can pass to them!  You may recognize these from code you saw in week 1!

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [W3Schools Java Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp)

        Please read this introduction regarding Java functions (methods)!

   - [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html)

        Please read this introduction to Apache Maven.  This is a commonly used Java build tool which is known for it's pom(Project Object Model)-based project organization structure as well as it's dependency management functionality!  While we will be starting into Spring.io relatively soon and won't be building manually with this tool I have historically built many Java-based projects using the Maven toolkit with Spring!
     
   - [Java DotEnv](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java)

        This project utilizes the Java port of DotEnv, which is a way to easily create and organize environment variables at the project-level.  You will see .env files everywhere in the working world as they are a super easy way to create variables you can use project-wide in a single, easily referenced place!

3. **Complete the following tasks**:
   - App.java

        Please review the App.java file.  You will find SEVERAL errors.  This week we will work on furthering your code-reading abilities through some hands-on practice!  The scenario is "Chett", a co-worker of yours you begrudingly deal with (read - spend a lot of time cleaning up after), has committed some modifications to this Java project in GitHub over the weekend.  Unfortunately...he didn't spend a lot of time reviewing and testing his changes before committing them.  To further the pain, he is out today and you are unable to get ahold of him (again).  Your task is to fix his errors and get this program to run again!  To do so you will need to:
        
        You will also want to make sure you have installed the Java extensions for Visual Studio Code!  This will allow you to press the "play" button at the top of the screen to run/debug your code!

        - Fill out the .env file in the project (I will provide the structure to you in your class Discord)
        - Fix the errors in the code with as few changes as possible (there are several!)
        - Once completed run the code and you should see a "Status: 200 - success" style message
   
4. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**
    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated python code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
